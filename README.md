# belly-button-challenge
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rar

 A bar chart and bubble chart was created to visualize the dataset.  We were able to create a dashboard which effectively displays demographic information for each test subject ID number in the dataset.  The demographic information that each subject includes ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location and belly button type.

 The bar chart displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button for the dataset.

 The bubble chart displays the bacteria culters per sample for the dataset.
